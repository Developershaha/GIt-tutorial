1) git init - powers your folder to be managed by git and initialise a new emplty .git folder that has all the releavant logic to manage version of your project 


2) rm -rf .git - remove the power or stop the tracing of that respository by git 

3) ls - show list of all the folder  and ls -a. shows hideen folder like .git 


------- AREA OF GIT 

1) WORKING AREA : --> there can be bunch of files that are not currently handle by git 
it means that changes done or to be done in those files are not manage by git yet . A file which is working area is consider to be not in the staging area . when we do `git status ` when we see bunch of untracked files then these are acutully called to be in the working area


2) STAGE AREA : what all files are part of next vesrion area . this staging area where git knows what changes will be done to the last vesrsion to next version 


3) RESPOSITORY AREA : this area actually contain details of all previous version resister version . and the file in the area , git already manages them and knows their version 

4) `git add <file> : -  moves file from working area to staging area 

5) git rm --cached <file > move from stataging area to working area 

6) meaning of COMMIT - cmommit is a perticular version of a project . It capture a particular snapshop of a project from staging area changes area craete a version out of it 

7) git commit : resister staging changes to a commit 

8) git log : list donw all the commits for the respository 
9) git restore <file> : it remove all files changes from the working  area to be committed . This can be usefull if we add some dirty peace of code and no more wanted 
instead of deleting every change line by line , we can restore or it we can say restore last version 

10) git restore -- staging <file> -- it removes files from stage area to working area 

-- git restore from statign area  

11) diff between git rm and git restore 
ans if you want to move whole file back to untracked area means working area then we do git rm otherwise if we want to move from staging or working are then do git restore
